# Spring Boot Annotations

1. The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a convenience annotation that combines the following three annotations:

   - `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: This annotation tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if `spring-webmvc` is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a `DispatcherServlet`.
   - `@ComponentScan`: Enables component scanning so that the web controller classes and other components you create will be automatically discovered and registered as beans in Springâ€™s application context.
   - `@Configuration`: Allows you to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes.

By using `@SpringBootApplication`, you can simplify your main class configuration. Here is an example:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MySpringBootApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This single annotation is often placed on the main class of your Spring Boot application, which serves as the entry point for the application.

Behind the scenes it:

- Scans classpath for Spring components
- Auto-configures beans based on dependencies
- Sets up embedded servers if present
- Configures logging, security, etc.
- Processes property files
- Creates ApplicationContext

2. `@RestController`: This annotation is a specialized version of the `@Controller` annotation. It is used to create RESTful web services using Spring MVC. It combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, eliminating the need to annotate every request handling method with `@ResponseBody`.

3. `@RequestMapping`: This annotation is used to map web requests to specific handler classes and/or handler methods. It can be applied at the class level and/or at the method level in a controller.

4. `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`: These are shortcut annotations for `@RequestMapping` with specific HTTP methods. They are used to map HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to specific handler methods.

5. `@PathVariable`: This annotation is used to extract values from the URI path and bind them to method parameters in a controller.

6. `@RequestParam`: This annotation is used to extract query parameters from the request URL and bind them to method parameters in a controller.

7. `@RequestBody`: This annotation is used to bind the HTTP request body to a method parameter in a controller.

8. `@ResponseBody`: This annotation is used to indicate that the return value of a method should be used as the response body of the HTTP response.

9. `@ResponseStatus`: This annotation is used to set the HTTP status code for the response.

10. `@ControllerAdvice`: This annotation is used to define global exception handling and data binding rules for all controllers in the application.

11. `@ExceptionHandler`: This annotation is used to define a method that handles specific exceptions thrown by controller methods.

12. `@Valid`: This annotation is used to trigger validation on the annotated object, typically a request body or a method parameter.

13. `@Validated`: This annotation is used to trigger validation on the annotated object, typically a request parameter.

14. `@CrossOrigin`: This annotation is used to enable cross-origin requests for a specific controller or method.

15. `@Async`: This annotation is used to indicate that a method should be executed asynchronously.

16. `@Scheduled`: This annotation is used to schedule a method to be executed at fixed intervals or cron expressions.

17. `@EnableScheduling`: This annotation is used to enable scheduling support in the application.

18. `@EnableAsync`: This annotation is used to enable asynchronous processing support in the application.

19. `@EnableWebMvc`: This annotation is used to enable Web MVC configuration in the application.

20. `@EnableWebSecurity`: This annotation is used to enable Web security configuration in the application.

21. `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity`: This annotation is used to enable global method security in the application.

22. `@EnableJpaAuditing`: This annotation is used to enable JPA Auditing in the application.

23. `@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)`: This annotation is used to enable auditing for the entity.

24. `@CreatedDate`, `@LastModifiedDate`, `@CreatedBy`, `@LastModifiedBy`: These annotations are used to enable auditing fields in the entity.

# AOP Notes

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. In Spring, AOP is used to define common behaviors that can be applied across various points in an application, such as logging, transaction management, and security.

Key concepts in AOP:

1. **Aspect**: A module that encapsulates a concern that cuts across multiple classes. An aspect is a combination of advice and pointcuts.
2. **Advice**: Action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Types of advice include:
   - `@Before`: Runs before the method execution.
   - `@After`: Runs after the method execution.
   - `@AfterReturning`: Runs after the method returns a result.
   - `@AfterThrowing`: Runs after the method throws an exception.
   - `@Around`: Runs before and after the method execution.
3. **Join Point**: A point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception.
4. **Pointcut**: A predicate that matches join points. Advice is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join point matched by the pointcut.
5. **Weaving**: The process of linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object. This can be done at compile time, load time, or runtime.

Example of AOP in Spring:

```java
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBeforeMethod() {
        System.out.println("Method execution started");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `LoggingAspect` class is an aspect that contains a `@Before` advice. The advice is applied to all methods in the `com.example.service` package, and it logs a message before the method execution.

To enable AOP in a Spring Boot application, use the `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` annotation in your main configuration class:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.EnableAspectJAutoProxy;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class MySpringBootApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This annotation enables support for handling components marked with `@Aspect` annotations, allowing Spring to process and apply the aspects.

# Explain Servlet and Servlet Container

## Servlet
A Servlet is a Java class used to process HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses in web applications. It follows the Java Servlet API and runs on a web server or servlet container.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Lifecycle Methods**:
  - `init()`: Initializes the servlet.
  - `service()`: Handles incoming requests (GET, POST, etc.) and generates responses.
  - `destroy()`: Cleans up resources before the servlet is destroyed.
- **Request-Response Model**:
  - Uses the `HTTPServletRequest` and `HTTPServletResponse` objects to handle client-server communication.
- **Annotations or Configurations**:
  - Can be configured in `web.xml` or using annotations like `@WebServlet`.
- **Purpose**:
  - Servlets are typically used for tasks like processing form data, managing session state, and dynamically generating web content.

## Servlet Container
A Servlet Container (or Web Container) is a component of a web server or application server that provides the runtime environment for servlets. Examples include Apache Tomcat, Jetty, and WildFly.

### Responsibilities:
- **Servlet Lifecycle Management**:
  - Manages the lifecycle of servlets (initialization, execution, and destruction).
- **Request Handling**:
  - Routes incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate servlet based on the URL mapping.
- **Multithreading**:
  - Handles multiple client requests simultaneously by creating threads for each request.
- **Session Management**:
  - Provides built-in mechanisms to handle sessions (e.g., cookies, URL rewriting).
- **JSP Support**:
  - Converts JavaServer Pages (JSP) into servlets for execution.
- **Security and Configuration**:
  - Handles authentication, authorization, and secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS).

# Explain Spring Boot Container

A Spring Boot container refers to the runtime environment where Spring Boot applications operate. It includes the following components and responsibilities:

### Dependency Injection (DI) Container:
- Manages the lifecycle and configuration of Spring beans (Java objects managed by Spring).
- Uses the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle to inject dependencies into components.

### Application Context:
- The heart of the Spring container.
- Manages bean creation, wiring, and lifecycle, along with resources like property files and message sources.

### Embedded Server Support:
- Spring Boot integrates with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, allowing applications to run independently without requiring an external server setup.

### Auto-Configuration:
- Spring Boot simplifies configuration by automatically setting up beans and services based on dependencies in the classpath.

### Bean Scanning and Configuration:
- Scans for components annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Controller`.
- Configures beans using annotations like `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, and `@ComponentScan`.

### Environment Abstraction:
- Provides tools to access environment variables and properties for application configuration, supporting profiles like dev, prod, etc.

# Explain Bean Container

A Bean Container is a core component of the Spring Framework that manages Java objects (beans) and their dependencies. It provides a runtime environment for creating, configuring, and managing beans within a Spring application.

### Key Features of a Bean Container:
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Manages bean dependencies and injects them into other beans.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Allows beans to be configured and managed by the container, reducing tight coupling between components.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Handles bean lifecycle events like initialization and destruction.
- **Scoping**: Supports different bean scopes like singleton, prototype, request, session, etc.
- **Configuration**: Provides mechanisms for configuring beans using XML, JavaConfig, or annotations.
- **Bean Post-Processing**: Allows custom processing of beans before or after initialization.
- **Autowiring**: Automatically wires dependencies based on type, name, or qualifiers.
- **Bean Definition**: Defines bean metadata like class, scope, dependencies, and initialization methods.

### Bean Factory vs. Application Context:
- **Bean Factory**: The simplest container providing basic DI features.
- **Application Context**: A more advanced container that extends Bean Factory with additional features like event propagation, resource loading, and internationalization support.

### Types of Bean Containers:
- **ClassPathXmlApplicationContext**: Loads bean definitions from XML configuration files.
- **AnnotationConfigApplicationContext**: Loads bean definitions from JavaConfig classes annotated with `@Configuration`.
- **GenericWebApplicationContext**: Web-specific container for web applications.
- **WebApplicationContext**: Interface for web application contexts.

### Bean Scopes:
- **Singleton**: A single instance per container.
- **Prototype**: A new instance for each request.
- **Request**: A single instance per HTTP request.
- **Session**: A single instance per HTTP session.
- **Global Session**: A single instance per global HTTP session.

# What is Bean?

In Spring, a bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC container. Beans are created, configured, and managed by the container, allowing for loose coupling and easy dependency injection.

### Key Characteristics of Beans:
- **Java Objects**: Beans are regular Java objects managed by the Spring container.
- **Configuration Metadata**: Beans are defined in configuration files (XML, JavaConfig) or using annotations.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Beans can have lifecycle callbacks like initialization and destruction methods.
- **Dependency Injection**: Beans can have dependencies injected by the container.
- **Scoping**: Beans can have different scopes like singleton, prototype, request, session, etc.

### Types of Beans:
- **Singleton**: A single instance per container.
- **Prototype**: A new instance for each request.
- **Request**: A single instance per HTTP request.
- **Session**: A single instance per HTTP session.
- **Global Session**: A single instance per global HTTP session.

### Bean Definition:
A bean definition is a configuration metadata that defines how a bean should be created, configured, and managed by the container. It includes information like the bean's class, dependencies, scope, initialization methods, and destruction methods.
