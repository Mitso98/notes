# What is Java?

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA).

# What are the main features of Java?

- Simple
- Object-Oriented
- Portable
- Platform independent
- Secured
- Robust
- Multithreaded
- Architecture neutral
- Interpreted
- High Performance
- Distributed
- Dynamic

# What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

**JDK (Java Development Kit):** It is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** It provides libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java. JRE is the implementation of JVM.

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** It is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms.

# What is a Class in Java?

A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.

# What is an Object in Java?

An object is an instance of a class. It has a state and behavior. The state is represented by attributes (fields) and the behavior is represented by methods.

# What is Inheritance in Java?

Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. The new class inherits the fields and methods of the existing class. It promotes code reusability.

# What is Polymorphism in Java?

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding).

# What is Encapsulation in Java?

Encapsulation is the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

# What is Abstraction in Java?

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

# What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class in Java?

**Abstract Class:** Can have abstract and non-abstract methods, can have instance variables, can provide the implementation of an interface, and can have constructors.

**Interface:** Can have only abstract methods (until Java 8, after which default and static methods are allowed), cannot have instance variables, cannot provide the implementation of an abstract class, and cannot have constructors.
