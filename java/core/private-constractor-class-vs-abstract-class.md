## Abstract Class vs Class with Private Constructor in Java

### Abstract Class
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and must be subclassed. It can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).

#### Key Points:
- Can have both abstract and concrete methods.
- Can have member variables.
- Can have constructors.
- Supports inheritance (a class can extend only one abstract class).
- Can provide a common base class for related classes.

#### Example:
```java
abstract class Animal {
    String name;

    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    abstract void makeSound();

    void sleep() {
        System.out.println(name + " is sleeping.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(name + " says: Woof Woof");
    }
}
```

### Class with Private Constructor
A class with a private constructor cannot be instantiated from outside the class. This is often used to implement the Singleton pattern or to create utility classes that should not be instantiated.

#### Key Points:
- Cannot be instantiated from outside the class.
- Can have static methods and fields.
- Cannot be subclassed if all constructors are private.
- Often used for Singleton pattern or utility classes.

#### Example:
```java
class UtilityClass {
    // Private constructor prevents instantiation
    private UtilityClass() {
    }

    public static void utilityMethod() {
        System.out.println("Utility method called");
    }
}

class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor prevents instantiation
    private Singleton() {
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Key Differences
- **Instantiation**: Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, but they can be subclassed. Classes with private constructors cannot be instantiated from outside the class.
- **Inheritance**: Abstract classes support inheritance and can be extended by other classes. Classes with private constructors cannot be subclassed if all constructors are private.
- **Usage**: Abstract classes are used to provide a common base class for related classes. Classes with private constructors are used to prevent instantiation and are often used for Singleton patterns or utility classes.

In summary, abstract classes are used to define a common base for related classes, while classes with private constructors are used to prevent instantiation and are often used for specific design patterns like Singleton or for utility classes.
