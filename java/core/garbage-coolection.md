## Garbage Collection in Java

Garbage collection (GC) is the process of automatically freeing memory by deleting objects that are no longer reachable in a program. Java provides several garbage collection algorithms, each suitable for different types of applications.

### 1. G1 Garbage Collector
The G1 (Garbage First) garbage collector is designed for applications that require low pause times and can handle large heaps. It divides the heap into regions and performs incremental garbage collection, which helps in achieving predictable pause times.

**Suitable for:** Applications requiring low latency and predictable pause times.

### 2. CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) Garbage Collector
The CMS garbage collector aims to minimize pause times by performing most of the garbage collection work concurrently with the application threads. It is suitable for applications that require low latency but can tolerate some degree of fragmentation.

**Suitable for:** Low latency applications where pause times need to be minimized.

### 3. Parallel Garbage Collector
The Parallel garbage collector, also known as the throughput collector, focuses on maximizing application throughput by using multiple threads for garbage collection. It is suitable for applications that can tolerate longer pause times but require high throughput.

**Suitable for:** Computation-intensive applications where throughput is more important than pause times.

### 4. Balanced Garbage Collection
For applications that require a balance between low latency and high throughput, the G1 garbage collector is often a good choice. It provides a balance by offering configurable pause times and efficient garbage collection.

**Suitable for:** Applications that need a balance between low latency and high throughput.

### Choosing the Right Garbage Collector
- **Low Latency Applications:** Use G1 or CMS garbage collector.
- **Computation-Intensive Applications:** Use Parallel garbage collector.
- **Balanced Applications:** Use G1 garbage collector.
