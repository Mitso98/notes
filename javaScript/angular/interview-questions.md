## Angular Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is Angular?
Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It is developed and maintained by Google.

### 2. What are the key features of Angular?
- **Two-way data binding**: Synchronizes data between model and view.
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages dependencies of components.
- **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom attributes and elements.
- **Components**: Building blocks of Angular applications.
- **Services**: Share data and logic across components.
- **Routing**: Navigate between different views or components.

### 3. What is a Component in Angular?
A component is a fundamental building block of Angular applications. It controls a part of the user interface and consists of an HTML template, a CSS stylesheet, and a TypeScript class.

### 4. What is a Directive in Angular?
A directive is a class that can modify the structure or behavior of elements in the DOM. There are three types of directives in Angular:
- **Component Directives**: Directives with a template.
- **Structural Directives**: Change the DOM layout by adding or removing elements (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor).
- **Attribute Directives**: Change the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g., ngClass, ngStyle).

### 5. What is Dependency Injection in Angular?
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. Angular's DI system provides dependencies to components, services, and other classes.

### 6. What is Angular CLI?
Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that simplifies the development process by automating tasks such as project setup, development server, building, and testing Angular applications.

### 7. What is a Service in Angular?
A service is a class that contains business logic, data access, or other reusable code. Services are typically used to share data and functionality across multiple components. They are injected into components using Angular's DI system.

### 8. What is RxJS in Angular?
RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using Observables. It allows developers to work with asynchronous data streams and handle events, HTTP requests, and other asynchronous operations in Angular applications.

### 9. What is Angular Router?
Angular Router is a module that provides navigation and routing capabilities in Angular applications. It allows developers to define routes, navigate between views, and manage application state based on the URL.

### 10. What is NgModule in Angular?
NgModule is a decorator that defines an Angular module. An Angular module is a container for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a set of capabilities. It can contain components, directives, pipes, and services.
